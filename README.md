# Push-Swap
This project challenges you to sort data on a stack using a minimal set of instructions. The goal is to develop an optimized algorithm in C to sort a list of integers with the fewest possible moves. Youâ€™ll work with two stacks and a defined set of operations to create the shortest sequence of steps (in Push Swap language) that accomplishes the sorting task efficiently.
